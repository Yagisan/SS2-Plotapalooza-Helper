## Semantic Versioning

This modlist uses a modified semantic versioning to identify which competition it is targeted at, where given a version number SEASON.CONTEST.PATCH, increment the:

1. SEASON version when the contest season changes. **Contest rules will change.**
2. CONTEST version when the contest changes. **Contest rules may change between contests.**
3. PATCH version when hotfixes and/or updates are released mid-contest.
